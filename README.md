# Just-RL: Reinforcement Learning from Scratch 🚀

📋 **Introduction**
Welcome to **Just-RL**, a personal deep dive into **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**. This repository is dedicated to implementing RL algorithms from scratch (with **PyTorch / JAX**), re-creating key ideas from influential papers, and building a strong theoretical and practical understanding of RL.

The journey begins with **CS285: Deep Reinforcement Learning (Berkeley)**, but extends far beyond it.
